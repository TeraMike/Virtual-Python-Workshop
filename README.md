# Virtual-Python-Workshop
For the storage of files featured in and pertaining to the virtual Python workshop for work experience students.

The course takes a four-lesson structure, spaced over most of a week. The model code follows this structure.

### Python Lessons

Contains:
- Four lesson notebooks

- Summary notebooks `Glossary` (summarising the content of all the lessons as a reference) and `Errors` (brief description of common error types and how to ask for help in the sessions).

- Folder of images for the notebooks.

### Model Code

Contains:
- A python file for each exercise, following the content of the lessons in order.

- A folder of code for specific exercises, either recurring ones across the lessons (such as guessTheNumber) or full versions of ones such as hangman and noughtsAndCrosses which appear in other exercises.
