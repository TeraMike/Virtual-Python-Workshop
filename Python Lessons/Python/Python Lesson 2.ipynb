    "Number variables can be interacted with as if they were numbers. `number *= 5` will multiply `number` by five.  \n",
    "You can convert a string to an integer by using `int()`, but this only works if your string is of an integer, like '5'. We can do the same thing with floats using `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, you can convert an integer to a string by using `str()`.  \n",
    "Strings can be added together, or concatenated, by using `+`. This can be done when assigning variables or when just printing things out.  \n",
    "`print('Hello', name + ', how are you?)` will output << Hello name, how are you? >> In a print statement, using '+' leaves no space between concatenated strings, using ',' does. You must use `+` to assign a concatenated string to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that user input can be taken by using input(). Input can take a text argument, like so:  \n",
    "`variable = input('Please enter your favourite food: ')` or you can separate it out:  \n",
    "`print('Please enter your favourite food!)  \n",
    "variable = input()`\n",
